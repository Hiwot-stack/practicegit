    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Hiwot. I am originally Ethiopia. I moved to the US five years ago. I am a happy mother of two. My undergraduate degree is in marketing management. In Ethiopia, I worked as a sales supervisor for a bottling company. Prior to the pandemic, I worked here as a front desk concierge. After that, I became a stay-at-home parent. I would characterize myself as determined, ambitious, and disciplined.</p>
